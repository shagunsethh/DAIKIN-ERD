# DAIKIN-ERD
This project aims to design an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for Daikin’s order management and service request system. The ERD provides a structured representation of key business entities, including customers, employees, orders, products, suppliers, inventory, and service requests.

# Objective

Optimizing order processing to reduce delays and errors.
Enhancing inventory tracking for better stock management.
Improving supplier coordination to ensure seamless procurement.
Managing service requests efficiently to enhance customer satisfaction.
